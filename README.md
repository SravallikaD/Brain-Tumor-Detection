# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is trained to classify whether a brain MRI contains a tumor or not. The dataset used is composed of MRI images, and the model is evaluated based on its accuracy in identifying tumors.
